  "[SEC] 1. Introduction": {
    "[SUBSEC] 1.1 Purpose": "The Print Management System (PMS) defines requirements for document transmission and printing in a LAN environment with ASCII and PostScript printers.",
    "[SUBSEC] 1.2 Scope": "PMS enables efficient document routing, format validation, and print job queuing, ensuring compatibility with various printer types.",
    "[SUBSEC] 1.3 Product Perspective": {
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.1 System Interfaces": "PMS integrates with network devices, document sources, and printer management systems.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.2 User Interfaces": "PMS provides an interface for document submission, print queue tracking, and job management.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.3 Hardware Interfaces": "PMS supports ASCII and PostScript printers within a LAN.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.4 Software Interfaces": "PMS utilizes TCP/IP for document transmission and printer communication.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.5 Communications Interfaces": "PMS transmits print jobs securely over the LAN.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.6 Memory Constraints": "PMS is optimized for large print queues and efficient packet processing.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.7 Operations": "PMS manages document routing, job prioritization, and printing.",
      "[SUBSUBSEC] 1.3.8 Site Adaptation Requirements": "PMS is configurable for different LAN topologies and printer setups.",
